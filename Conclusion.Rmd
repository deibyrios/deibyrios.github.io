## Conclusion

###So does the newly built Second Avenue line affect the economy on the Upper East Side? 

After our [EDA](EDA-Building_Permits.html "our EDA Journey") we've come to the conclusion that the number of building permits filed is related to the distance to the 2nd Ave Line subway project. The buildings closer to the project generally show a higher increase in building permits than buildings away from the project. Similarly, we can see patterns in the Phase 1 of the [real estate sales](EDA-Real_State_Sales.html "our EDA Journey") that show activities for the opening of the Second Avenue line. There is a lack of activity in the current Phase 2 location, but we think it's because the subway has not opened yet. 

Based on our analysis of [EDA](EDA-Property_Market_Values.html), we found its effect inconclusive for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 to the 2nd Ave Line project. However, we also analyzed properties within few blocks from the Second Avenue line and the increase in market value is very similar across different categories of properties based on their distance to the project. Hence, we think that these inconclusive results are caused by the way in which the New York City Department of Finance (DOF) estimates the increase in market values as their estimates are based on recent sales in the whole neighborhood 
( [see FAQs - What is Market Value? in the DOF's assessments website](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-assessments.page "DOF's website - Assessment") ).

We didn't performed further analyses by comparing with other neighborhoods because we think that other neighborhoods may have their own realities and their own causes for fluctuation in value.

In conclusion, we think the newly built Second Avenue line does affect the economy of the Upper East Side.

_Note_: <br>
1) Since the Property Market Value data offered by the The Department of Finance (DOF) goes back to 2008 only, while news about the project and properties in the area of influence becoming more valued, date many years back, we also performed an [Analysis of Property 'Assessed Values'](EDA-Property_Assessed_Values.html "EDA - Property Assessed Values") which are used for Property Tax purposes and are linearly correlated to Property 'Market Values' (just applying a percentage depending on the tax class, see https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/property/learn/howassess.htm) because we were able to find property "Assessed Values" back to 2003; but we got very similar results, again, may be due to the fact in which the Property 'Market Values' (and consequently 'Assessed Values') are estimated.

2) As an interesting finding of both phases, there is an association between the distance to the project and the average increase in building permits for buildings located to the right of the 2nd Ave Line. Also, buildings located by the East river show a slightly higher increase in permit counts, which may be caused by water views, which attracts more projects.
