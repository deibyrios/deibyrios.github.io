<h1>Does the newly built Second Avenue line affect the economy on the Upper East Side?</h1>
<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>How does $17 Billion Dollars and the 100-year-old, and still ongoing, New York City Second Ave Line project affect the economical development on the Upper East Side? To answer our main (and ambitious) question, our strategy was to look into different economic aspects of the economy to see whether the project has positively influenced the following measurement in its immediate area of influence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remodeling of existing and new construction buildings</li>
<li>Real Estate Sales</li>
<li>Property Market Values</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, as a fun section in the end, we have also decided to look into the New York City Dog Licensing Dataset as a comparison to how the subway line may have affected dog owners on the Upper East Side!</p>

<div id="why-we-chose-this-topic" class="section level3">
<h3>Why we chose this topic</h3>
<p>Over budget and overdue, the 2nd Ave Subway is one of the most ambitious transportation development projects in New York City. With a project of this stake, we expect there to be a tremendous impact on the real estate market. We are interested in understanding how the current subway line affects property values because we are self-interested in real estate investment in the city.</p>

<h3>Project Background</h3>
<p><br><br> <img src="images/3D-view-phases.png" /> Image from: <a href="http://www.apta.com/previousmc/multimodal/previous/2010/Presentations/Planning-for-the-Second-Avenue-Subway-From-Dream-to.pdf" class="uri">http://www.apta.com/previousmc/multimodal/previous/2010/Presentations/Planning-for-the-Second-Avenue-Subway-From-Dream-to.pdf</a> <br></p>
<p>The Second Avenue Subway, which runs under Second Avenue on the East Side of Manhattan, has been proposed since 1920. The first phase of the line, consisting of three stations on the Upper East Side, started construction in 2007 and opened in 2017 - ninety-seven years after the route was first proposed. Many distinct plans for the Second Avenue subway lines were never carried out up until the 1960s although small segments were built in the 1970s. The complex reasons for these delays are why the line is sometimes referred to as “the line that time forgot” (source: Wikipedia).</p>
<p>A brief summary of more important milestones:</p>
<ul>
<li>1919: original proposal.<br />
</li>
<li>1942 - 1956: Parallel elevated lines along the Second Avenue and Third Avenue were demolished<br />
</li>
<li>1960: Increase in development on East Side; existing Lexington Avenue Line became overcrowded.<br />
</li>
<li>1967: voters approved a Transportation Bond Issue, which provided over $600 million (worth $4,404,000,000 today) for New York City projects. The City secured a $25 million Urban Mass Transportation Act (UMTA) grant for initial construction.<br />
</li>
<li>1972: Construction on the line finally began<br />
</li>
<li>1975: Initial construction was halted because of the New York City’s fiscal crisis; tunnels were sealed later.</li>
<li>1999: MTA Study proposed a new subway service from 63rd Street up on the Second Avenue to 125th Street.</li>
<li>2000: MTA Capital Program Review Board approved the MTA’s 2000-2004 Capital Program, which allocated $1.05 billion for the construction of the 2nd Avenue Line.<br />
</li>
<li>2001: the Federal Transit Administration approved the start of preliminary engineering on a full-length 2nd Ave Line.<br />
</li>
<li>2004: Approval of MTA’s environmental impact statement (FEIS) proposing a two-track line from 125th Street and Lexington Avenue in Harlem, through the Second Avenue to Hanover Square in the Financial District, to be build in 4 phases:<br />
</li>
<li>Phase 1 rerouted the Q service via the BMT 63rd Street Line and north along Second Avenue, to the Upper East Side at 96th Street.</li>
<li>Phase 2 will extend the rerouted Q train to 125th Street and Lexington Avenue.<br />
</li>
<li>Phase 3 will run from 125th Street to Houston Street.<br />
</li>
<li>Phase 4 will extend service from Houston Street to Hanover Square in Lower Manhattan.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase 1 only:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2005: Voters passed a transportation bond issue on November 8, 2005, allowing for dedicated funding allocated for phase 1.<br />
</li>
<li>2006: United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) gave $1.3 billion in federal funding for phase 1 to be funded over a seven-year period. Preliminary engineering and a final tunnel design was completed.</li>
<li>2007: Construction started.<br />
</li>
<li>2017: After several news about progress and delays, phase 1 completed and the stations opened on Jan 1st. Consisting of the 96th Street, 86th Street, and 72nd Street stations over two miles (3.2 km) of tunnel, this phase costed about $4.45 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phase 2 only:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2015: Phase 2 was allocated $535 million in the MTA’s 2015-2019 Capital Plan for planning, design, environmental studies, and utility relocation.<br />
</li>
<li>2016: In March, MTA began advertising Requests for Proposals (RFP) for three new contracts. In April 2016, the MTA and the State of New York reached a deal to restore funding to Phase 2, with a total of $1.035 billion allocated. On May 24, 2017, the MTA Board increased funding to $1.735 billion.<br />
</li>
<li>2017: By August 2017, preliminary work on the line was underway, and the engineering firm AKRF had been updating the environmental impact study.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Phases 3 and 4:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Phases 3 and 4 have no funding commitments yet.</li>
</ul>
