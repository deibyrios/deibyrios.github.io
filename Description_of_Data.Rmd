## Description of Data

As mentioned in the [Introduction](./), our strategy was to develop different analyses of different areas to answer our main question. 
  
### Remodeling of existing and construction of new buildings   
  
Before any construction project begins in New York City, an application must be submitted for review by the Department of Buildings to make sure that the plans are in compliance with Building Codes. The majority of construction requires a Department of Buildings permit.
  
The data we were able to get show details for every building permits filed with the Department of Buildings, available for download from [The NYC Open Data portal](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Permit-Issuance/ipu4-2q9a "NYC Open Data portal"). This dataset includes a list of building permits filed for a particular day from 1990 to date. It contains building permits for both new constructions and alterations/remodeling.
  
A Data Dictionary containing field codes and descriptions of the data set can be dowloaded  [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/ipu4-2q9a/files/87608d5b-1986-4a21-a8a5-7a38e65f9993?download=true&filename=DD_DOB_Permit_Issuance_2018-03-07.xlsx "Data Dictionary for building permits").
    
      
### Real State Sales

The New York City Department of Finance keeps a record of every real estate transaction that is sold in the city from 2003 till 2016, and a rolling sales report of the last 12 months. In addition to this dataset, Baruch College compiled the same dataset with geocoordinates for each of the properties. With the two datasets, we are able to locate all real estate sales in the city and where they are located on the maps. 

The sources of the datasets can be found here:

  1) [NYC Department of Finance](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-annualized-sales-update.page "Data for Real Estate")
  
  2) [Baruch College](https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/confluence/display/geoportal/NYC+Geocoded+Real+Estate+Sales "Data for Real Estate")
  
  
These datasets include all types of real estate property (tax class), coordinates, block numbers, square footage of land, and date of sales. In this dataset, we focused on the date of sales, coordinates, block numbers, and tax class. 

For more information, a description of all of the fields can be found [here](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/finance/downloads/pdf/07pdf/glossary_rsf071607.pdf "Data for Real Estate")
    
  
### Property Market Values

We got the market values dataset from The Department of Finance (DoF), which estimates the market value for all New York City properties every year and compares each property market value with recent sales in the neighborhood. The estimated market value is used by the DoF to determine what the City's property tax rates are applied to the assessed value in order to calculate the property taxes for the next tax year.
  
The data can be accessed and downloaded directly from [the DOF's website here](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-assessments.page "Data for Property Market Values")
     
On the website, we were able to find the tentative property assessment for fiscal year 2019 (with a total NYC property Market Value of about $1.258 trillion, an increase of $108.4 billion, a 9.4 percent growth from the 2018 Fiscal Year), as well as the final property assessments from 2018 fiscal year, back to 2009 fiscal year, **with one dataset for each year**.
   
A data dictionary containing field codes and descriptions of the data sets can be accessed [here](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/finance/downloads/tar/tarfieldcodes.pdf "Data Dictionary for property market values").

The data consists of many Access databases so we used the RODBC library to read the databases using "odbcConnectAccess('my_Access_Database_to_read.mdb')". 
   
### Property Assessed Values
   
Since our analyses of Property Market Values were inconclusive to answer our question, the public data offered by the DoF for Market Values dates back to 2007 only, and news about the project and properties in the area of influence are becoming more valued, we have performed additional research and were able to find each property's "Assessed Values" back to 2003 in the "Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output" (PLUTO) dataset. This dataset is developed by the New York City Department of City Planning's (DCP) Information Technology Division (ITD), which is the New York City's primary land use agency.

Although each property's "Assessed Value" is different from each property's "Market Value", we found that they are linearly correlated, [according to the NY state DoF](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/property/learn/howassess.htm "source of info"). The property's "Assessed Value" is a percentage of the estimated "Market Value" of a property depending of the tax class. For example, the market value for that class is equal to the assessment value in a city or town assessing at 100% of market value for a specific tax class.

The PLUTO datasets that we used are an extensive land use and geographic data at the tax lot level, containing more than seventy fields derived from data maintained by different city agencies.

The data can be accessed and downloaded directly from [the DCP's website here](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/bytes-archive.page?sorts[year]=0 "Data for Property Assessed Values"). We were able to find the property assessed values from 2003 to 2017, a dataset for each year.

A Data Dictionary containing field codes and descriptions of the datasets can be accessed [here](http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/open-data/pluto_datadictionary.pdf "Data Dictionary for property assessed values").

The datasets are shapefiles so we used the "foreign" library to read the data files of the shapefiles using "read.dbf('my_shapefile_to_read.dbf')". 
  
  
### NYC Dog Licensing Dataset 

As all dog owners residing in NYC are required by law to license their dogs, we acquired this dataset through NYC Open Data: 
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/NYC-Dog-Licensing-Dataset/nu7n-tubp 

The dataset is sourced from the DOHMH Dog Licensing System (https://a816-healthpsi.nyc.gov/DogLicense), where owners can apply for and renew dog licenses. 

The dataset contains fifteen columns, informing us the general information of a registered pet dog: the animal name, animal gender, animal birth month, breed name, borough, zip code, to name a few. We focused on the dogâ€™s breed, gender, date of birth, zip codes for our analysis. 

A complete description and preview of the variables are available here:
