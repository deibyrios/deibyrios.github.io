<h2>Analysis of Property Market Values</h2>
<p>One of the analysis we decided to perform to answer our question, was to see if the 2nd Ave Line project has affected the Market Value of property located in the project’s area of influence (basically, phase 1 and 2, because phase 3 and 4 have no funding commitments yet).</p>
<p>As mentioned in the <a href="Description_of_Data.html">Description of Data</a>, We got the market values dataset from The Department of Finance (DOF), which every year estimates the property’s market value for all New York City properties, comparing each property market value with recent sales in the neighborhood.</p>
<div id="analysis-of-market-values-for-phase-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Analysis of Market Values for Phase 1</h3>
<p>To try to see if the 2nd Ave Line project has affected the Market Value of property located near the Line, we added a column called “Distance” and used the block number to record the approximate distance (in blocks) from each property, to the 2nd Ave Line.</p>
<p>For this purpose, we used the Block number column/variable and the official tax map for the City of New York, which graphically shows the the block number, street names and other information in the map. The link where we were able to access the online Digital Tax Map is: <a href="http://gis.nyc.gov/taxmap/map.html" class="uri">http://gis.nyc.gov/taxmap/map.html</a></p>
<p>In such map, we were able to manually place the pre-existing Lexington-Fourth Avenue Line (green line), the phase 1 of the 2nd Ave project (yellow line) and the stations entrances, to visually determine the block numbers that are near the phase 1 of the 2nd Ave line and their distance (in blocks) to the Line and to an station entrance:</p>
<p><img src="images/blocksphase1.png" /> <br><br></p>
<p>When determining the distances of the properties to the 2nd Ave line, we differentiated between properties to the left of the 2nd Ave Line and properties to the right of the Line, because we suspected that the influence of the 2nd Ave Line may be greater for properties to the right of the line than for properties to the left, due to the proximity of the pre-existing Lexington-Fourth Avenue green Line right to the left of the 2nd Ave Line project. <br><br></p>
<p><strong>Properties on the left side of the 2nd Ave Line - Phase 1</strong></p>
<p>For blocks to the left of the 2nd Ave Line, as we can see in the map above, we can determine 3 different categories:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>block numbers that are within 1 block to the left;</li>
<li>block numbers that are within 2-3 blocks to the left; and</li>
<li>block numbers that are within 4-5 blocks to the left; from the 2nd Ave Line</li>
</ol>
<p>Using the block numbers for each of the 3 categories detailed above, we can add a column called “Distance” and use the block number to record the approximate distance (in blocks) from each property to the left of the 2nd Ave Line - Phase 1:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
property_upper_east &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/property_upper_east.csv&quot;)
data_phase1 &lt;- property_upper_east %&gt;%
  mutate(Distance = ifelse(BLOCK %in% c(1424:1427, 1529:1532,1539:1541,1423,1428:1433,

                                 &#39;1 block left from 2nd Ave Line&#39;,
                          ifelse(BLOCK %in% c(1404:1407,1512:1515,1522:1524,1403,1408:1413,

                                 &#39;2-3 blocks left from 2nd Ave Line&#39;,
                          ifelse(BLOCK %in% c(1384:1387,1495:1498,1505:1507,1383,1388:1393,
                                              1491:1494,1499:1504,1602),
                                 &#39;4-5 blocks left from 2nd Ave Line&#39;,
                                 &#39;other&#39;))))
#write.table(data_phase1, file=&quot;Market_Value_phase1_left.csv&quot;,sep=&quot;,&quot;,row.names=F)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can visualize and compare the variation of Property Market Values over time, among the different categories detailed above.</p>
<p>For this purpose, we first summarize by Year and Distance, then we scale the data and create an index to visualize variation in market value over time with time series lines:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#First, summarize by Year and Distance:
data_phase1 &lt;- data_phase1 %&gt;% 
  group_by(Year, Distance) %&gt;% 
  summarise(Total = sum(FULLVAL))

#Now, scale the data and create an index to visualize variations over time, then plot:
data_phase1 &lt;- data_phase1 %&gt;% group_by(Distance) %&gt;%
  #filter(Year &gt;= 2001 &amp; Year &lt;= 2017) %&gt;%
  filter(Distance != &quot;other&quot;) %&gt;%
  mutate(index = 100*Total/Total[1]) %&gt;% ungroup()

#Plot time series:
library(ggthemes)
ggplot(data_phase1, aes(Year, index, color = Distance)) + geom_line(lwd = 1) +
    ggtitle(&quot;Market Value Vs Distance to 2nd Ave (Phase1 - Left)&quot;) +
    labs (x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Indexed Variation in Market Value&quot;) +
    theme_grey(16) +
    theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
    scale_colour_colorblind()</code></pre>
<p><img src="EDA-Property_Market_Values_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" /><!-- --> <br></p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> From the graph above, we think that it is inconclusive whether phase 1 of the 2nd Ave Line project is having an impact on the increase in Property Market Value, for properties located in the vicinity to the left of the Line. On the contrary, we can see that properties located within 4-5 blocks left from the Line show a slightly higher increase than properties in other categories. <br></p>
<p><strong>Properties on the right side of the 2nd Ave Line - Phase 1</strong></p>
<p>For blocks to the right of the 2nd Ave Line, as we can see in the map previously shared above, there are just 3 blocks between the 2nd Ave Line and the East River, except for a small row of few blocks located four blocks from the Line (at the north end), so we established 3 different categories as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>block numbers that are within 1 block to the right;</li>
<li>block numbers that are within 2 blocks to the right; and</li>
<li>block numbers that are within 3-4 blocks to the right; from the 2nd Ave Line</li>
</ol>
<p>Using the block numbers for each of those 3 categories, we followed the same procedure described above to analyze properties to the left, going back to the original data to add a column called “Distance” and using the block number to record the approximate distance (in blocks) from each property to the right of the 2nd Ave Line - phase 1:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data_phase1 &lt;- property_upper_east %&gt;%
  mutate(Distance = ifelse(BLOCK %in% c(1444:1447,1546:1549,1556:1558,1443,1448:1453,

                                 &#39;1 block right from 2nd Ave Line&#39;,
                          ifelse(BLOCK %in% c(1464:1467,1563:1566,1573,1463,1468:1473,
                                              1559:1562,1567:1571,1690),
                                 &#39;2 blocks right from 2nd Ave Line&#39;,
                          ifelse(BLOCK %in% c(1482:1484,1580:1583,1480,1485:1490,1576:1579,

                                 &#39;3-4 blocks right from 2nd Ave Line&#39;,
                                 &#39;other&#39;))))</code></pre>
<p>Now we can visualize and compare the variation of Property Market Values over time, among the different categories detailed above, by following the same procedure described previously:</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> From the graph above, similar to property to the left, we think that it is inconclusive whether phase 1 of the 2nd Ave Line project is having an impact on the increase in Property Market Value for properties located in the vicinity to the right of the Line. The increase in market value seems very similar across the different categories.</p>
<p>An <strong>important observation</strong> is that the publicly available data offered by the DOF, goes back to 2008 only, while news about the project and properties in the area of influence becoming more valued, date back to 1919, with one of the most important milestones occurring on year 2000 when the MTA Capital Program Review Board approved the MTA’s 2000-2004 Capital Program, which allocated $1.05 billion for the construction of the 2nd Avenue Line, with several other milestones occurring before 2007 when constructions started, so maybe the effect of the line in property market values, occurred in previous years, before the start of the construction. <br><br></p>
<div id="analysis-of-market-values-for-phase-2" class="section level5">
<h5><strong>Analysis of Market Values for Phase 2</strong></h5>
<p>For phase 2 of the project, we followed the same procedure, using the planned path and stations for phase 2 of 2nd Ave Line project, adding a column called “Distance” and using the block number to record the approximate distance (in blocks) from each property, to the planned phase 2 of the 2nd Ave Line.</p>
<p>As described above, we used the Block number column/variable and the official tax map for the City of New York, which graphically shows the the block number (<a href="http://gis.nyc.gov/taxmap/map.html" class="uri">http://gis.nyc.gov/taxmap/map.html</a>) so we generated the following image, where we placed the pre-existing Lexington-Fourth Avenue Line (green line), the phase 2 of the 2nd Ave project (yellow line) and the stations entrances, to visually determine the block numbers that are near the planned phase 2 of the 2nd Ave line and their distance (in blocks) to the Line:</p>
<p><img src="images/blocksphase2.png" /> <br><br></p>
<p>Using the map above, we determined the following 4 categories:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>block numbers that are within 1 block to the left;</li>
<li>block numbers that are within 1 block to the right;</li>
<li>block numbers that are within 2-3 blocks to the left; and</li>

<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> From the graph above we think that it is inconclusive whether the planned phase 2 of the 2nd Ave Line project is having an impact on the increase in Property Market Value for properties located in the vicinity of the Line. On the contrary, we can see that properties located within 2-3 blocks from the Line, show a slightly higher increase than properties located within 1 block from the Line.</p>
<p>Because the increase in market value seems very similar across the different categories, we think that this may be due to the way in which the New York City Department of Finance (DOF) estimates the increase in market values of the properties, as their estimates are based on recent sales in the whole neighborhood ( <a href="http://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/property-assessments.page" title="DOF&#39;s website - Assessment">see FAQs - What is Market Value? in the DOF’s assessments website</a> ), so our analysis being performed with only few blocks of difference is just showing very similar increase patterns.</p>
<p>We didn’t performed further analysis by comparing with other neighborhoods because we think that other neighborhoods may have their own realities and their own causes for increases and decreases in values. <br><br></p>
<p><strong>Additional work performed:</strong> As observed before, the publicly available data offered by the DOF, goes back to 2008 only, while news about the project and properties in the area of influence becoming more valued, date back to 1919, with one of the most important milestones occurring on year 2000 when the MTA Capital Program Review Board approved the MTA’s 2000-2004 Capital Program, which allocated $1.05 billion for the construction of the 2nd Avenue Line, with several other milestones occurring before 2007 when construction of the phase 1 started, so <em>maybe the effect of the line in property market values near both phase 1 and phase 2, occurred in previous years</em>, before the start of the construction of phase 1 while the project was finally becoming a reality.</p>
<p><em>So, as additional work</em>, since we wanted to analyse years previous to the commencement of the construction of phase 1, we performed an additional research and were able to find property “Assessed Values” back to 2003 in the “Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output” (PLUTO) dataset, developed by the New York City Department of City Planning’s (DCP) Information Technology Division (ITD), which is New York City’s primary land use agency.</p>
<p>Although the property “Assessed Values” are different from property “Market Values”, we found that they are linearly correlated since, according to the NY state DOF (<a href="https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/property/learn/howassess.htm" class="uri">https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/property/learn/howassess.htm</a>), the property “Assessed Value” is a percentage of the estimated “Market Value” of a property depending of the tax class so, as example, in a city or town assessing at 100% of market value for a specific tax class, the market value for that class is equal to the assessment value.</p>
<p>due to the extensive work needed to read and pre-process the data (one data file per year), the additional work performed is presented in separately and can be found here: <a href="EDA-Property_Assessed_Values.html" title="Additional work - Analysis of Property Assessed Values">Analysis of Property Assessed Values</a></p>
